# Automated Physical Bullion Value Tracker
Hello and welcome to my 1st personal Python project!


This code allows for the automatic update of personally owned physical bullion (gold and silver) values on a daily basis (every 12.00 PM noon).

The code will produce an Excel file with said bullion details.

Each Excel file is named on a date and time basis to keep track of each file.

A .bat file which was made along with the code, can be opened in order to create an Excel file with the immediate bullion values.
